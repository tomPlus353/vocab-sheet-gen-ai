1.  **Vocabulary Extraction:**
    *   Analyze the provided Japanese text and identify 20-30 words that would likely be challenging for intermediate to advanced Japanese language learners (JLPT N3 level and above) in a business context.
    *   Prioritize words that are:
        *   Less commonly used in everyday conversation but may be common within specific industries (especially IT).
        *   Written in Kanji, especially words with multiple possible readings (though be mindful that less-common katakana words may also be challenging).
        *   Onomatopoeia (though use your judgement; some are very common).
    *   Do *not* select extremely common, basic words that most learners at this level would already know.
2.  **Definitions:**
    *   For each selected word, provide a concise and clear definition in English.
    *   Ensure the definition is appropriate for a business context, reflecting the meaning relevant to an IT engineer.
3.  **Example Sentences:**
    *   For each selected word, create ONE or TWO example sentences in Japanese that:
        *   Demonstrate the meaning clearly
        *   Include the selected word
        *   Are natural-sounding and grammatically correct.
    * Include furigana when there are multiple possible readings.
4.  **Brevity:**
    * You are expected to produce a cheatsheet and nothing else.
    * Apart from the cheatsheet to do reply to the user, explain anything say anything else.
